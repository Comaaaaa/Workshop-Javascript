## 1. Introduction to JavaScript: From C to Web Programming
JavaScript, unlike C which is a procedural language, is the scripting language of the web. It was initially developed to enhance web browsers' interactivity. Now it has extended its influence to servers via Node.js and even mobile app development.

**Exercise:** Research and note down key differences between C and JavaScript.

---

## 2. Embedding JavaScript into HTML
JavaScript can be integrated directly within HTML documents, enabling dynamic interactions on web pages.

```html
<!-- Inline JavaScript -->
<script>
  alert("Hello, World!");
</script>

<!-- External JavaScript -->
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

**Exercise:** Make a basic HTML file and embed an interactive JavaScript function, such as a button that shows an alert when clicked.

---

## 3. Variables, Constants, and Data Types
JavaScript has dynamic types, a contrast to C's statically-typed nature.

```javascript
let name = "John";    // string
let age = 25;        // number
const isStudent = true;  // boolean, constant value
```

**Exercise:** Create and log variables of different types. Experiment with type conversions.

---

## 4. JavaScript Operators
Understanding arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators in JavaScript.

Don't panic ! Here are some ressources : 

- https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp

**Exercise:** Write a program that performs various operations on multiple numbers and logs the results.

---

## 5. Control Structures in JavaScript vs. C
Learn how loops, conditionals, and other control structures differ between C and JavaScript.

ðŸ“š Refer to [MDN's Control Flow and Error Handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling) 

**Exercise:** Convert a `for` loop from C to JavaScript and note the differences.

---

## 6. Functions in JavaScript
An introduction to function hoisting, first-class functions, and other unique characteristics of JavaScript functions.

**Exercise:** Define a function in both C and JavaScript that returns the square of a number.

---

## 7. DOM Manipulation and Events
Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) and how JavaScript interacts with it to create dynamic web content.

**Exercise:** Create a webpage with a button that, when clicked, changes the content of a paragraph element.

---

## 8. Introduction to npm and the Node.js Ecosystem
A brief intro to Node.js, its significance, and the npm (Node Package Manager).

**Exercise:** Install an npm package and utilize it in a basic Node.js script.

---

## 9. Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await
Delve into asynchronous programming in JavaScript, from callbacks to modern Async/Await.

ðŸ“š For a detailed guide, refer to [MDN's Asynchronous Programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous).

**Exercise:** Write a function that mimics a delay (using `setTimeout`) and then logs a message.

---

## 10. Working with AJAX and Fetch API
A primer on making web requests in JavaScript and handling responses.

**Exercise:** Use the Fetch API to retrieve data from a public API and log the results.

**Bonus:** Display the informations fetched with the API with a local website

End of the course overview. Transitioning from C to JavaScript can be challenging due to different paradigms, but with persistence and practice, you'll become proficient in no time. Always refer to the official [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) for more information. Happy coding!
